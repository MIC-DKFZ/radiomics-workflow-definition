This directory contains the anonymized results of all rounds of the delphi process conducted by the SPP 2177 in 2022 in order to find a consensus radiomics workflow definition.

The delphi process can be divided into 2 objectives:
1. Workflow Definition Consensus Process  (Round 1, 2 and 4)
2. Challenge Characterization Process (Round 3 and 5)

The delphi process in its results are also described in the following publication:
