# Radiomics Workflow Definition (RWD)

The RWD project provides a radiomics workflow definition and a space for the community for collaborative editing and enhancing the definition.
RWD was initiated by the DFG priority program [Radiomics: Next Generation of Biomedical Imaging (SPP 2177)](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/radiomics.html) based on the results of the radiomics workflow definition consensus process which was conducted within the DFG priority program [Radiomics: Next Generation of Biomedical Imaging (SPP 2177)](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/radiomics.html).

## Purpose
Lack of standardization represents one major obstacle to successful clinical translation
of radiomics. Looking at the current literature it becomes evident that currently no consensus exists on the used terminology and that the used terms are even partially conflicting. This lack of standardize definition makes solving the other challenges unnecessary complicated. To address this problem, to overcome semantic inconsistencies between existing definitions and to offer a well-defined, broad,
referenceable terminology, a consensus workflow definition for radiomics-based setups and a terms mapping to existing literature were compiled.
