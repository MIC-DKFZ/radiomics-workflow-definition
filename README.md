# Radiomics Workflow Definition (RWD)

The RWD project provides a radiomics workflow definition and a collaborative space for the community to enhance and refine this definition.
RWD was initiated by the DFG priority program [Radiomics: Next Generation of Biomedical Imaging (SPP 2177)](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/radiomics.html), based on the results of the consensus process conducted within the same program.

## Purpose

A lack of standardization is a significant obstacle to the successful clinical translation of radiomics. Current literature shows no consensus on the terminology used, with some terms being partially conflicting. For more details, see the results in [Floca 2024](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-024-01704-w) and the associated [supplement](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/radiomics-workflow-definition/blob/main/publications/Floca%20224/Supplement1%20-%20List%20of%20extracted%20terms%20and%20mapping.pdf). This lack of standardized definitions complicates addressing other challenges in the field.

To tackle this problem and overcome semantic inconsistencies between existing definitions, we compiled a consensus workflow definition for radiomics-based setups and a mapping of terms to existing literature. The purpose of this project is to make these results available and offer the community a platform to further develop a comprehensive, widely accepted radiomics workflow definition.

## Content

- **Publications:** Contains a list of all publications that are directly associated with the RWD and, if available, also the publication itself.
- **Resources:** Contains the RWD, the mapping table, and other relevant assets to apply the RWD.
- **Surveys:** Contains all kinds of expert surveys done so far in the context of the RWD.

Feel free to contribute and help us improve the radiomics workflow definition!
